export function ReadingList(){
  // FUNCTIONALITY
    // Takes in the current state of the tree, and performs a tree walk
    // For each node in the tree, checks whether it's pinned and if so generates
    // a json object containing all of the metadata required to generate a reading list

    // Need to look into the most extensible way of exporting a reading list
      // Should support many different formats
      // Should be exportable as raw JSON
      // Should be exportable to Zotero and Mendeley (any others? ask Ellie)
